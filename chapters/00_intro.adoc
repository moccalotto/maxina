Welcome. This is the Maxina tabletop roleplaying game. It’s a pretty
conventional tabletop rpg. We assume that you have prior knowledge of rpgs. If
you haven’t, there are a myriad of free resources such as blogs, vlogs,
podcasts, videos, etc you can consult to get you primed.

The game takes place in an alternate future where magic and cyberware exist
side-by-side and technology, although advanced, can seem much more crude than
the tech we use today. 

We’ve written a small primer on the world in the Maxina Campaign booklet. You
do not need that booklet to play the game; we’ve written it tgive you some
fluff and inspiration, but you can make the game your own by inventing your own
background history.
