NOTE: Beastkin are more than just one single ancestry. They are an entire class
of ancestries, including such members as wolfkin, bearkin, apekin, ravenkin,
eaglekin, lizardkin, and the like.  Most beastkin sub-species are tied to a
specific species of animal.

When magic entered the world, about 1 percent of all humans became bonded with
newly awoken animal spirits. The majority of the humans bonded were those
living in close harmony with nature, such as indigenous peoples.  The bonded
people, called Beastkin, gained some of the traits of their bonded spirit. Some
grew wolf ears, others bear paws, and others grew fur, feathers, scales, large
canines, or tails. Their descendants are now formally known as Beastkin, but a
slew of derogatory nicknames exist for each beastkin subtype.
