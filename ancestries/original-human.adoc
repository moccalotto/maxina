> Origina, Purist, Mundo, Normie


Original humans have not been modified by technology or magic. They are as
average as you and I. Original Humans suffer less racism than the other 21st
century ancestries.


Dual Nature::
Original Humans gain access to the special Dual Nature perk that allows them to
use magical abilities and cyberware at the same time, something that cannot
normally be done. In order to use supernatural abilities, you must still have
the Mage, Shaman, or Monk perk.

Extra Perk::
Original Human characters have an extra Perk of their choosing, giving them a
total of two free perks at character creation.

Extra Skill::
Original Humans characters gain the Extra Skill Perk for free.
